Homework 3 consists of 7 zylab assignments from chapter 10 and 11 that cover classes, lists, and dictionaries. 

main-1 (10.11) requires the implementation of classes and constructors to develop a program for calculating the nutritional information of various food items the user provides as inputs. Fat, carbohydrate, and protein values are provided by the user and the program calculates the calories in the given number of servings and displays the information in the program. That's done by usinng FoodItem as a class and adding a constructor to initialize the food items. 

main-2 (10.15) is also a class based program that is developed to calculate and display the losing/winning averages of teams provided as inputs. This assignment consists of Team class implementation, a constructor, and a class method for the calculations.

main-3 (10.17) is part 1 of a bigger assignment to program a shopping cart. This program allows user to input food items' name, price, and quantity and get the total cost for it. For this assignment we use the class ItemToPurchase, constructor to initialize name, price, and quantity and a class method to print the total cost of the items. The program takes two food items' information and displays the calculation.

main-4 (10.19) is part 2 and the extension of part 1 that turns this program into a shopping cart. User is able to add as many items as they desire, remove items, change the quantity, etc. Additional information such as the item description is added in this program. Here, in addition to ItemToPurchase class another class ShoppingCart is used to implement the methods of adding, removing, and updating items in the cart, all of which options are provided in a looping menu. 

main-5 (11.18) is a simple program that takes integers as input and returns a sorted and filtered output. Negative integers are filtered out of the list, so the list only displays non-negative values. The program uses a for loop and sorted() function to output the result.

main-6 (11.22) is also another very simple program that returns the frequency of words in a list. The program counts the number of times each word appears in the list input and outputs that result. We implement for loop and count method to calculate the frequency.

main-7 (11.27) is a program with the implementation of dictionaries that stores roster and rating information for a soccer team. It takes 5 pairs of inputs for the players' jersey numbers and their ratings and stores them in a dictionary. The dictionary's elements are then displayed in ascending order. The program also develops a bunch of menu options to add new players, remove players, change player ratings, display players above a certain rating, etc. All the outputs are displayed in a sorted ascending order. The menu is built with a while loop and nested if statements, similar to that of main-4.
